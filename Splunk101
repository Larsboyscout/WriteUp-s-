# Project: Analyzing Attacks with Splunk
**Lab Source:** TryHackMe (Room: Splunk 101)

## 🎯 Executive Summary
In this investigation, I acted as a SOC Analyst to analyze a series of web server logs. The objective was to identify the source of a brute-force attack and determine if any accounts were successfully compromised.

## 🔍 Investigation Steps
1. **Initial Discovery:** I used Splunk Processing Language (SPL) to search for HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status codes.
   - `index=main sourcetype=access_combined status=401`
2. **Identifying the Attacker:** By aggregating the results, I identified a single IP address `[Attacker_IP]` responsible for over 500 failed login attempts in 10 minutes.
3. **Confirming Compromise:** I pivoted my search to find any HTTP 200 (Success) codes originating from that same IP.

## 🛡️ SOC Analyst Insights (Detection & Mitigation)
- **Detection Logic:** A real-world alert should be triggered if a single IP generates >20 failed login attempts within 1 minute.
- **Mitigation:** Implement account lockout policies and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to neutralize the impact of stolen credentials.
